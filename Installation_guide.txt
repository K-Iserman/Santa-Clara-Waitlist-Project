Santa Clara University
Waitlist Application

This system was designed and implemented in the Linux environment for use on the Santa Clara University's Engineering Computing Center.

System Requirements:
Linux Operating System
Apache Webserver
PHP 5

**Note** The implementation uses the PHP SoapClient module (Available PHP 5.0.1 or later)
	 At the time the system was developed, the Engineering Computing Center did NOT have the module installed.
	 To work around this, we compiled a cgi executable of PHP with the module enabled (included with the source)
	 To use this module, please follow the instructions in step 4 to modify the appropriate .htaccess files to enable 
	 use of the included PHP version. Otherwise, remove the file to prevent the system from using the local PHP version.

Installation

1. Copy the [name] directory into your web directory.

2. Create a .htpasswd file using this command:
	
	htpasswd -c /path/of/your/choice/.htpasswd user1
	
   You will be prompted to enter a password for that user
  
   To add additional users use the same command with out the "-c" option

	htpasswd /path/of/your/choice/.htpasswd user2

3. In the admin directory

	- edit the .htaccess file and change the path to the .htpasswd file you created earlier

4. In the php_test directory

	- edit the .htaccess file and change the Action path to the path WITHIN your web directory
	
		/path/in/web/directory/php_test/cgi-bin/php-cgi.cgi

5. Navigate to your  your.server.address/php_test/student/student.php and verify that the application is working by checking both student and admin portals
