This project is a waitlisting system for waitlists of classes for Santa Clara University. 
If a class is full,a student can be put onto a waitlist for the course and potentially get in. 
This system gives a simple interface for the students to fill out the required information,
as well as an interface for instructors and administrators to view the waitlist information.
